> Here is an overview of all my stuff.
> 
> [3th] Diamond Collecting Game: This is a project where I learn about graphics and things like shadows, light, textures, and animation.
> 
> [2nd] Paper Pushing Game: This is a project where I learn about TDD. This project has a backend with 100% mutation testing coverage OwO I gave it a frontend for viewing purposes.
> 
> [1st] Virtual Pet: This is a project where I learn about Angular and limit test the capabilities of CSS, like animation.
> 
> [0th] Ball Game: This is a project where I learn about OOP concepts like abstraction and low coupling and stuff.
>
> Here is an overview of all my private projects because they have no frontend.
> 
> * Machine Learning: I had something with regression, something with classification, and something with clustering. I also made a car detector, a 2by2 cube solver, and a 2D procedure world generator.
> * Computational Photography: I made an image morphoer and a seam carver. There is really no easy way to explain what this is. Use Google.com
> * Socket Programming: I made an FTP server and a FTP client to use the FTP server.
> * More TDD: I did some stuff with property tests, mock tests, benchmarks, and UI tests.
> * And more miscellaneous stuff.

> # Usage :hugs:
> 
> Here is a running instance of the project:

>
> The first 5 seconds will be laggy because of graphics initializing and coupling, textures, and engine stress.
