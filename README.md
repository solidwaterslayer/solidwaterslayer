> 
> * ```Machine Learning```: I did something with **regression**, something with **classification**, and something with **clustering**. I also made a car detector, a 2x2 cube solver using **A***, and a 2D procedure world generator.
> * ```Computational Photography```: I did **image morphing** and a **seam carving**. There is really no easy way to explain what this is. Use Google.com
> * ```Socket Programming```: I made an **FTP server** with 10 commands and a **FTP client** to use the **FTP server**.
> * ```More TDD```: I did some stuff with **property tests**, **mock tests**, **benchmarks**, and **UI tests**. :joy:
> * And more miscellaneous stuff, like a script that deletes all the videos in my youtube watch later list because for some reason youtube removed the ability to mass delete this as of March 19, 2022. :innocent:
