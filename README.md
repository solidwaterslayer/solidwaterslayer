> Here is an overview of all my stuff.
> 
> * **[3th] Diamond Collecting Game**: This is a project where I learn about graphics and things like shadows, light, textures, and animation.
> 
> * **[2nd] Paper Pushing Game**: This is a project where I learn about TDD. This project has a backend with 100% mutation testing coverage OwO I gave it a frontend for viewing purposes.
> 
> * **[1st] Virtual Pet**: This is a project where I learn about Angular and limit test the capabilities of CSS, like animation.
> 
> * **[0th] Ball Game**: This is a project where I learn about OOP concepts like abstraction and low coupling and stuff.
>
> Here is an overview of all my private projects because they have no frontend.
> 
> * **Machine Learning**: I had something with regression, something with classification, and something with clustering. I also made a car detector, a 2by2 cube solver, and a 2D procedure world generator.
> * **Computational Photography**: I made an image morphoer and a seam carver. There is really no easy way to explain what this is. Use Google.com
> * **Socket Programming**: I made an FTP server with 10 commands and a FTP client to use the FTP server.
> * **More TDD**: I did some stuff with property tests, mock tests, benchmarks, and UI tests.
> * And more miscellaneous stuff, like a script that deletes all the videos in my youtube watch later list because for some reason youtube removed the ability to mass delete this.
